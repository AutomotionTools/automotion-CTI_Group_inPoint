## Replace native keyboard shortcuts

The native behaviour of the 'I' and 'O' keyboard shortcuts in After Effects is to move the CTI to the in/outPoint of the top-most layer. You can use these scripts to change this behaviour. Add '00_' to the start of each filename, and place the files into the After Effects 'Scripts' folder. You can then change the 'I' and 'O' keyboard shortcuts to run these scripts.
