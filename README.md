## automotion-CTI_Group_inPoint

Moves the active comp's CTI to the earliest inPoint of a group of selected layers.


## automotion-CTI_Group_outPoint

Moves the active comp's CTI to the latest outPoint of a group of selected layers.

**Optional:** Change the 'nativeOutPoint' variable to 'false' to move the CTI to the true end of the selection. Set this to 'true' for the native behaviour, which moves the CTI to the end of the selection, minus 1 frame.


## Replace native keyboard shortcuts

The native behaviour of the 'I' and 'O' keyboard shortcuts in After Effects is to move the CTI to the in/outPoint of the top-most layer. You can use these scripts to change this behaviour. Place them into the After Effects 'Scripts' folder, and you can then assign the 'I' and 'O' keyboard shortcuts to them.
