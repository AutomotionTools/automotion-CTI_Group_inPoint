## Replace native keyboard shortcuts

The native behaviour of the 'I' and 'O' keyboard shortcuts in After Effects is to move the CTI to the in/outPoint of the top-most layer. You can use these scripts to change this behaviour. Place them into the After Effects 'Scripts' folder, and you can then assign the 'I' and 'O' keyboard shortcuts to them.
